Twitter troll detection using rnn-lstm
check pdf for full report

The aim of this project is the detection of Social Media Trolls. A troll is a
person who makes a deliberately offensive or provocative online post. In other
words, a troll is a person whose main objective is to start quarrels, spread fake
information, and provoke people by sending offensive messages. General wely,
trolls tend to preserve an anonymous identity so they could feel at ease on social
media networks.
In order to maintain the authenticity and quality of the information displayed
online and create a friendlier social media experience, it has become necessary
to monitor the content posted, and identify the trolls to minimize the level of
damage against users (bullying, harassment...), and lessen the amount of fake
information spread.
In our project, we will be looking forward to detect the probability of a tweet
being posted by a troll, since Twitter is one of the most famous platforms where
people interact and share their thoughts towards a certain subject.
